# Retrieval Augmented Generation using Pinecone
This repository contains code for implementing retrieval augmented generation using Pinecone, a vector database for building real-time applications with natural language search.

# Overview
Retrieval augmented generation is a technique where a model generates text conditioned on retrieved information from a database. In this project, we utilize Pinecone to efficiently retrieve relevant information based on user queries and use this information to enhance text generation.

# Features
Integration with Pinecone: Utilize Pinecone's vector search capabilities to retrieve relevant information.
Text Generation: Generate text based on the retrieved information using language models like GPT.
Scalability: Pinecone provides scalability and low-latency retrieval, making it suitable for real-time applications.
